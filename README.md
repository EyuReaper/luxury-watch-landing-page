## Key Features

- **Animated Watch Hands**: The watch hands are animated using CSS transforms and keyframes, providing a realistic timekeeping effect.
- **Product Gallery**: A responsive product gallery that uses CSS Grid in a masonry layout, allowing for seamless adaptation to various screen sizes.
- **Smooth Parallax Scrolling**: Sections that utilize parallax scrolling effects, creating depth and a dynamic feel as users scroll through the page.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: A CSS-only toggle for switching between dark and light themes, enhancing user accessibility and personalization.

## Implementation Focus

- **Transform Origin**: Utilizes `transform-origin` for accurate rotations of watch hands, ensuring they pivot around the correct point.
- **CSS Grid**: Implements CSS Grid with the `minmax()` function to create a responsive gallery layout that adjusts based on screen size.
- **Perspective and Translate3D**: Leverages `perspective` and `translate3d` to achieve sophisticated parallax effects, enhancing visual depth.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Uses CSS variables for theme switching, allowing for easy management of styles across different themes.
